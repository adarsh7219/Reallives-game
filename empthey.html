                <p>Teaching empathy is a difficult task because empathy is a feeling; it is experiential.

                    Role-playing is one of the age-old methods to evoke feelings within oneself. We often advise people
                    to walk a mile in someone’s shoes before judging them – ie, we indicate that after walking a mile in
                    someone’s shoes, our empathy will take precedence over any desire to judge people.

                    RealLives provides not merely a simulation where one can lead lives of other humans, but it is also
                    a simulation that is built on authentic real-world data.

                    Thus, when one lives the life of a child subjected to poverty in a particular country, one knows and
                    understands that this experience is authentic – derived from the statistical data about poverty and
                    deprivation in that country.

                    This authenticity of data translates into authenticity of experience – thus enhancing one’s
                    affective experience; just as we are more affected by movies that we know to be based on real
                    happenings.

                    In addition, Social and emotional learning also is part of living in the simulation. The simulation
                    allows you to implicitly understand that if you take up a bad habit or refuse to engage in
                    constructive activities, your health or career will suffer. This leads to more emotionally literate
                    behaviors, like internalizing the benefits of delayed gratification, even without theoretical
                    teaching.
