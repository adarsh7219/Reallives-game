                <p>RL Academic provides a range of Lesson Plans that can serve as templates for various academic
                    exercises that use RL as its experiential basis. Many academicians across the world have used
                    RealLives in innovative ways, for their educational intent. You may access the various related
                    research papers and case studies

                    RL is a gamified simulation that replicates the data-driven conditions of almost 200 countries

                    In the simulation, you can lead a birth-to-death life in the simulation, to acquire a data-supported
                    idea of the conditions across the world

                    Guided by a teacher, RL can offer the students a unique, empathy-evoking peek at the unknown world
                    from within

                    RL was originally invented by a Schoolteacher in 2004 It was developed to be a place of experience –
                    which would serve as the basis for teaching</p>

                <p>Playing RL before discussing Distributive justice helps to problematize the meritocratic norm by
                    showing how a person’s circumstances can restrict their opportunities. This facilitates a more open
                    discussion…

                <p>Like the Drosophila (fruit fly) is useful for genetic studies because of its short life cycle, RL can
                    take students for a data-supported experience of life in another country in a matter of 45-60
                    minutes
